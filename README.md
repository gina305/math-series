## Feature Tasks and Requirements
* Create a module series.py.
* Add a file test_series.py to your repository. As you work on the tasks below, use TDD practices. Write tests first, then implement code. Make small changes with many cycles of Red-Green-Refactor

Create the feature using TDD.

1. Test-driven development (TDD) is an approach to software development where you write tests first, then use those tests to drive the design and development of your software application. Use the Red, Green, Refactor method:
* Red — think about what you want to develop 
* Green — think about how to make your tests pass
* Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

Code Academy depicts the TDD lifecycle as follows:
